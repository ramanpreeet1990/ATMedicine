#AnyTimeMedicine - a Healthcare Solution Android app

1. In today’s fast paced world - stress, headache, body aches, nausea, obesity, joint pains, anxiety, depression etc. are some of the many mundane health issues that everyone faces.

2. Due to paucity of time and the hectic lifestyles that we are into, many of us tend to avoid visiting a physician; thereby exacerbating the problem. Over a period of time these health concerns become so trivial that they affect our personal, professional and social lives greatly.

3. Thus in order to prevent any petty health concern from becoming a grave medical issue, we are designing an android based mobile application that aims at providing one stop medical solution to the user by recommending Over-The-Counter medicines and home remedies that are not just easy to access but will also rule out the need to visit a doctor.

4. The application in addition to above should also help an individual keep track of his/her diet by recommending diet plans on the basis of his/her BMI( Body Mass Index).

5. In case of an emergency the application should also locate healthcare centres closest to user’s location covered under his/her health insurance.
