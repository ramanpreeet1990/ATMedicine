# <p align="center">ATM - AnyTimeMedicine<br/>a personal healthcare solution</br>CSE 542</p>

-> In today’s fast paced world - stress, headache, body aches, nausea, obesity, joint pains, anxiety, depression etc. are some of the many mundane health issues that everyone faces.

-> Due to paucity of time and the hectic lifestyles that we are into, many of us tend to avoid visiting a physician; thereby exacerbating the problem. Over a period of time these health concerns become so trivial that they affect our personal, professional and social lives greatly.

-> Thus in order to prevent any petty health concern from becoming a grave medical issue, we are designing an android based mobile application that aims at providing one stop medical solution to the user by recommending Over-The-Counter medicines and home remedies that are not just easy to access but will also rule out the need to visit a doctor.

-> The application in addition to above should also help an individual keep track of his/her diet by recommending diet plans on the basis of his/her BMI( Body Mass Index).

-> In case of an emergency the application should also locate healthcare centres closest to user’s location covered under his/her health insurance.
